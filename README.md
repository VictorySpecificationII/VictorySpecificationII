Hi, I’m Antreas Christofi.

I am an infrastructure engineer focused on GPU-accelerated HPC systems, distributed storage, and cluster infrastructure. My work spans SLURM-managed clusters, InfiniBand fabrics, and Ceph-based storage, with an emphasis on reliability, performance, and first-principles reasoning.

I am particularly interested in the design and operation of large-scale AI infrastructure, and in understanding how workload characteristics translate into physical and distributed system requirements.

Recent work:
First-principles AI GPU infrastructure reference architecture
